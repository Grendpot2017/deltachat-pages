# Privacy Policy Delta Chat Apps 

### How Delta Chat complies to the GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is often regarded
as the furthest reaching legislation for privacy protection of users. 
On this page we detail how the Delta Chat app and website complies 
with GDPR requirements. 

- Implements the **Privacy by Design** requirement of the GDPR, through

  - **Confidentiality**: End-to-end encryption when possible, by implementing [Autocrypt
  Level 1](https://autocrypt.org).

  - **Data minimization**: No uploading of address-book content.

  - **Data avoidance**: No Delta Chat server, no processing of personal data.

- Does not require any **consent** (article 7 GDPR) from the users or their contacts (data subjects), because no address-book data is transmitted.

- Pode ser usado **sem necessidade de contratação ou instruções** de qualquer entidade controladora (organização), visto que nenhum terceiro a mais irá processar o e-mail e dados pessoais correlatos.


### How data controllers (organizations) benefit from using Delta Chat in complying to the GDPR

- Não gera **requisitos adicionais de informação** para o controlador direta ou indiretamente quanto aos sujeitos de dados 
  relativamente a qualquer coleta de dados de livros de endereços, artigo 13, 14 do GDPR.

- Needs **no data protection impact assessment**  to be carried out for Delta Chat (Article 35 GDPR), because it processes no particular additional data beyond E-Mail messenging.

- Adicionar medidas de privacidade do Delta Chat ao 
  **histórico de atividades processadas** pode gerar um impacto positivo 
  em eventual **documentação de evidências**, (artigo 30 do GDPR) 
  bem como no **processo de certificação de proteção de dados**, artigo 25 (3), 42 do GDPR.

- O **histórico de processamento de atividades** ligado à comunicação pelo mensageiro
reduz-se a identificar os provedores de e-mail e gravar suas atividades, artigo 30 (2) do GDPR.

- Riscos remanescentes aos direitos e liberdades das pessoas naturais 
  são, geralmente, também limitados aos dados de comunicação processados 
  pelo controlador e provedores de e-mail.

When voluntarily subscribing to the Delta mailing lists, your email address
from the input mask, the IP address of the calling computer, date and time of

purpose of processing the contacts and the delivery of the public community
communication. As usual with open source projects, the shared messages can also
be found in public archives. The legal basis for processing with consent is
Art. 6 I lit. a GDPR. The user's e-mail address is only stored as long as the

cancellation and, if necessary, restriction of the processing. You can revoke
the declaration of consent of the mailing list at any time. You have the right
to receive the data in a structured common and machine-readable format and the
right to complain to a supervisory authority.

### Amendment of the privacy policy

We reserve the right to update the present data protection regulations in view
of the constantly changing legal and technical situation.
