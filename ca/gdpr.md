# Política de privacitat per les apps de Delta Chat

### Com  compleix Delta Chat amb el RGPD

El Reglament General de Protecció de Dades (RGPD) sovint és vist com
la legislació més avançada en la protecció de la privacitat dels usuaris.
En aquesta pàgina detallem com l'app de Delta Chat i la seva web
donen compliment als requeriments del RGPD.

- Implements the **Privacy by Design** requirement of the GDPR, through

  - **Confidentiality**: End-to-end encryption when possible, by implementing [Autocrypt
  Level 1](https://autocrypt.org).

  - **Data minimization**: No uploading of address-book content.

  - **Data avoidance**: No Delta Chat server, no processing of personal data.

- Does not require any **consent** (article 7 GDPR) from the users or their contacts (data subjects), because no address-book data is transmitted.

- Can be used **without requiring a contract or instructions** from any controller (organisation), because no additional third party will process the E-Mail related personal data. 


### How data controllers (organizations) benefit from using Delta Chat in complying to the GDPR

- Creates **no additional information requirements** for the controller towards direct or indirect data subjects 
  regarding any collection of address-book-data, article 13, 14 GDPR.

- Needs **no data protection impact assessment**  to be carried out for Delta Chat (Article 35 GDPR), because it processes no particular additional data beyond E-Mail messenging.

- Adding Delta Chat's privacy measures to the 
  **record of processing activities** can have a positive impact 
  on eventual **evidence documentation**, (article 30 GDPR) 
  as well as on the **data protection certification process**, Article 25 (3), 42 GDPR.

- The **record of processing activities** linked to the messenger-communication is
  reduced to identifying the email-providers and recording their activities, Article 30 (2) GDPR.

- Remaining risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons 
  are generally also limited to the communication data processed 
  by the controller and the email providers.



This statement reflects the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as of 16.05.2018.


### Dades d'ubicació

If you share your location in a chat,
this location data is treated like other messages.
Delta Chat will use your location data to display your locations
to the other members of the chat.

Location data is collected even when the app is closed or not in use
– for as long as you keep this optional feature activated.

### Delta mailing lists

When voluntarily subscribing to the Delta mailing lists, your email address
from the input mask, the IP address of the calling computer, date and time of
registration are transmitted. The processing of this data is solely for the
purpose of processing the contacts and the delivery of the public community
communication. As usual with open source projects, the shared messages can also
be found in public archives. The legal basis for processing with consent is
Art. 6 I lit. a GDPR. The user's e-mail address is only stored as long as the
subscription to the e-mail list is active. By unsubscribing from any mailing
list, a revocation of consent is possible.

incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to rectification/completion,
cancellation and, if necessary, restriction of the processing. You can revoke
the declaration of consent of the mailing list at any time. You have the right
to receive the data in a structured common and machine-readable format and the
right to complain to a supervisory authority.

### Amendment of the privacy policy

We reserve the right to update the present data protection regulations in view
of the constantly changing legal and technical situation.
