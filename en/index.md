# Chat over e-mail and head back to the future with us!

**Delta Chat is like Telegram or Whatsapp but without the tracking or central control.**
Delta Chat does not need your phone number. Check out our [privacy statement](gdpr).

**Delta Chat doesn't have their own servers** but uses the most massive and diverse open messaging 
system ever: the existing e-mail server network.

**Chat with anyone if you know their e-mail address, no need for them to install DeltaChat!** 
All you need is a standard e-mail account.

Please check [get.delta.chat](https://get.delta.chat) and the [latest blog posts](blog)
for information on current releases and events. 

Delta Chat is [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)
and [Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software).  You can use,
see, change, and share it at will, with everyone.
