# Delta Chat Changelog

## v0.16.0
2018-03-19

* Messages from normal clients to more than one recipient create an implicit "ad-hoc group"
* Allow group creation though contact requests
* Always display the _sending_ time in the chat list; the list itself is sorted by _receiving_ time and "Message info" shows both times now
* If parts but the footnote are cut from mails, this is indicated by "..."; use "Message info" to get the full text
* Highlight the subject in the "Message info"
* Autoconfigure prefers 'https' over 'http'
* Bug fixes, eg. avoid freezes if the connection is lost
