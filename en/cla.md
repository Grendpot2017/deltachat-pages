# Thank you for contributing to our Project ...

... to continue we need to solve some bureaucratic issues:

This Contributor License Agreement from and between _Merlinux GmbH_, with office at 
_Reichgrafen Str. 20, 79102 Freiburg_, and the contributor is a modified version of the Open Whisper Systems Contributor License agreement. 

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person to us (Merlinux GmbH),
we must have a Contributor License Agreement on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. 
This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Merlinux; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

# Contributor License Agreement

1. Definitions.
   “You” (or “Your”) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized 
   by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Merlinux GmbH.
   For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities
   that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that
   entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this
   definition, “control” means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the 
   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, 
   or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares,
   or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
   
   “Contribution” shall mean any original work of authorship or invention,
   including any modifications or additions to an existing work, 
   that is intentionally submitted by You to Merlinux for inclusion in,
   or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by 
   Merlinux (the “Work”). For the purposes of this definition,
   
   “Submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication
   sent to Merlinux or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and
   issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Merlinux for
   the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
   communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in 
   writing by You as “Not a Contribution.”

2. Submission. Before making a submission in any form to the project you must 
   afree to the terms of this Agreement. The given Agreement covers any and all
   of your future or actual submissions.
   
3. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   Agreement, You hereby grant to Merlinux and to recipients of software
   distributed by Merlinux a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
   royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative
   works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute Your
   Contributions and such derivative works, as well as the right to sublicense
   and have sublicensed all of the foregoing rights, through multiple tiers of
   sublicensees.
   
4. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   Agreement, You hereby grant to Merlinux and to recipients of software
   distributed by Merlinux a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
   royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license
   to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
   the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by
   combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
   Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation
   against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in
   a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have
   contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
   patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that
   Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
   
5. Entitled to Grant License. You represent that you are legally entitled to
   grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual
   property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent
   that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that
   employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your contributions
   to Merlinux, or that your employer has executed with Merlinux a separate
   contributor license agreement substantially similar to this Agreement.
   
6. Originla Creation. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your
   original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). 
   You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details 
   of any third-party license or other restriction (including,
   but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are
   personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

7. Support. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
   except to the extent You desire to provide support.
   
8. Third-party materials. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your
   original creation, You may submit it to Merlinux separately from any
   Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any
   license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents,
   trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and
   conspicuously marking the work as “Not a Contribution”. Third-party materials
   licensed pursuant to: [license name(s) here]” (substituting the bracketed
   text with the appropriate license name(s)).
   
9. Notifications. You agree to notify Merlinux of any facts or circumstances 
   of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate
   in any respect.
