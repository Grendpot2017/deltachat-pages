# Delta.Chat – a data protection compliant messenger app

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) becomes enforceable on 25 May 2018 and aims primarily to  strengthen the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data as well as the convergence of the economies within the internal market, through the harmonisation of data protection standards across the EU member states. 

Although the GDPR is not explicitly regulating messenger communication it is nevertheless  enforcing the protection of personal data through a new range of respective rights for the concerned individuals and legal obligations on firms (controller), significantly fining companies for infringements. 

Delta Chat as a complementary decentralized messaging tool offers solutions to privacy concerns around centralized, mobile identity-tied messengers and is therefore a data protection compliant solution for company-internal and private communication, as well as messenger communication in repressive contexts. 

	Generale GDPR compilance

Key to understanding Delta.Chats compliance with the new reglementation is it’s operating without a central server: instead of custom ports it uses the normal e-mail service port, making use of the e-mail provider infrastructure offered by SMTP and IMAP services. This has an crucial impact on privacy issues around data subject identification, data security and controller independence.

	Data subject identification 

Delta.Chat works with any e-mail provider, using e-mail accounts instead of mobile numbers witch is in effect implying that users can assume, change or discard multiple identities, making it overall harder to identify the Data subject. 

By implementing Delta.Chats decentralized messaging approach the processor ensures the 		ongoing confidentiality and integrity of processing system and services. Delta chat is 		therefore a appropriate technical and organisational measures  within the meaning of 		Article 5 (1)(f) - Article 32 (1)(b), Article 5 (1)(f) GDPR.

Moreover there is no necessity for uploading the personal adress book to a centralized app specific server.

Without the access to the adress book of users, the controller implement an appropriate 	measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data which are necessary are 		processed. - Article 25 (1) GDPR (Data protection by design and by default). 
The Data collection/treatment will be then more adequate, relevant and limited to what is 	necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed  - Article 5 (1)(c) 		GDPR (data minimisation).

	Data Security 

DeltaChat users can exchange end-to-end encrypted messages with other Autocrypt-capable e-mail aps, no matter which e-mail provider either person is using. 

Encryption is explicitly mentioned as a suitable technical and organisational measures to 	secure personal data in Article 32 (1) GDPR. The reglementation emphasizes the practice of 	dataprotection from unauthorised access, recital 39 S. 12. 

Furthermore  due to it’s serverless operating Delta.Chat based communication is less vulnerable to censorship via service blocking. 

GDPR recognizes the risk of availability absence due to technical incidents. It is the 		responsible parties and/or order processors to ensure the integrity and availability of 	processing systems and services as well as the the ability to restore the availability and 	access to personal data, Article 32 (1)(b),(c) GDPR.

Delta.Chat attempts to reduce remaining risks and uncertainties related with the email-provider itself by improving convenient methods for performing out-of-band verification of public key material between peers. 

The creation and improvement of security features such as out-of-band Key-verficiation in 	the controller data management is an privacy by default-measures ensuring that the 		requirements of this Regulation are met, recital 78 (3) GDPR. 

	Controller independence

Delta.Chat will allow organizations to manage their own messaging infrastructure by developing Delta-apps with off-the-shell email server software, freeing them from the practice of  trusting an external entity with there data treatment. 

The GDPR contains a variety of legal obligations on the responsible parties, including 		integrity and confidentiality as well as transparency. The compilance with the latest 		regulation should not be left to often large companies, without any actual control over 	there privacy protection policies.
