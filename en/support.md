# Translation

Help to translate Delta Chat into your language using 
[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/delta-chat/delta-chat-android/).
Alternatively, you can download [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/master/MessengerProj/src/main/res/values/strings.xml) and [send](imprint) us the translated version.

We're also searching for people who would like to maintain the Transifex page and the contact with the translators.


# Development

We are looking for open source developers who are familiar with C, Java, Android, iOS, Windows, Linux or Mac.
Edit your own [Delta Chat](https://github.com/deltachat/) fork and send a pull request.

The same applies for **this webpage** - no matter if you have bigger or smaller improvements: Easily edit this page [here](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-pages) and send us a pull request.

# Recommendation

Currently Delta Chat is still in beta state and is only suitable for early adopters. People using it today should consider that things are changing. With Version 1.0 Delta Chat will become market-ready and a recommendation for _everyone_. 


# Bug Reports

Use our **Issue Trackers** to report bugs. Please add a detailed problem description. A screenshot is often helpful, too.
