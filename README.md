Translate the website
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can edit and improve the existing translations with [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/delta-chat/delta-chat-pages/); if you want to add a new language, please add it there or [contact us](https://delta.chat/en/contribute#channels).

To update the translations from the Transifex server, see the scripts and the documentation in the `tools` folder.

How to create a new blog post
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- In the directory `_posts` create new file in the form `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` eg. by copying an existing file
- Write your blog post to the file and do not forget to add or modify the `title:` and `author:` line atop
- That's all, the result goes to https://delta.chat/en/blog , the [RSS-Feed](https://delta.chat/feed.xml), [Twitter @delta_chat](https://twitter.com/delta_chat), [Friendica](https://ennibook.de/profile/delta_chat) and maybe even more.

Some Hints
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- whereever possible, use **Markdown** instead of HTML, esp. in the files that should be translated
- **no JavaScript** whereever possible, no **weird CSS** nor other complicated things
- the layout should be **as simple as possible** and should always work on **small mobile screens** as well as on **desktops**
- when layouting, do not force a special structure.  Header, Content, Footer - done.
- no complex navigation - Simply link subpages from the main pages
- **no one-page-layout** - we also have sites with long text, and we do not want to have separate layouts
- we do not want a complex navigation, some toplinks, a footer, done.
- Remember: **Form follows function, KISS.** The site should be dead-simple.
- Finally: Have fun :-)

Directory structure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- `/en` `/de` .. directories containing all language files. Subdirectories in these directories are _not allowed_ (relative links will fail then)
- `/_layouts` - this directory contains a default layout template for each language (the layout is references in Markdown using _layout: name_)
- `/assets` - page specific images and files; in general, we use one subdirectory per page or section here
- `/assets/css` - CSS and layout specific images and files here.

If you **add a new language** do not forget to check the automatic language selection in `index.html` in the root directory.
