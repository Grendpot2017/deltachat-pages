### Можно рекомендовать слепым людям

_"I installed Delta Chat last night, just after writing to you,
and I immediately noticed the improvement in accessibility [...]
And it works! And it's accessible! And I can recommend the app to other blind people!                                 
Good job guys! [...]"_

**Слепой пользователь** про Android-версию в 2019 году, по электронной почте delta@merlinux.eu

### Popular in regions with strict Internet governance

_"There's this nice messenger, based on a simple email, called Delta Chat. I am happy that our Internet watchdog has made this app popular by trying to block it. It's just like with Telegram that has become widely popular across non-tech audiences after the ban"._ 

**Russian user** from 2020 in response to Delta Chat's rejection to satisfy Russian Internet watchdog RKN's request for user data, via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Alex0s/status/1256841124427313153)

### Chatty interface with robust encryption

_"Other things I know I'm late to the party on but delta-chat seems really neat, especially if you have privacy concerns, since it's really just a specialized encryption heavy email client that presents a chat interface"_

**American user** from 2020 recommending Delta Chat for everyday usage

### Works during Internet shutdowns

_"I was happy that I could get Delta Chat from the website, not just via Google Play since it was blocked in Belarus. It was a bit slow to get the apk, but once I got the app, it worked just fine. We could share some photos and even videos encrypted"_ 

**Belarusian user** during protests in August 2020, via email to delta@merlinux.eu

### Перенесена система оповещения компании

_"Yes, our company have migrated
all billing/outage notification systems
from Telegram to Delta Chat
in order to improve corporate secrecy,
thus our cameras send intrusion detection alerts
to a delta group chat."_

**Early user** from 2018 from the [support forum](https://support.delta.chat/t/clear-chat-function/163/6)


### Электронная почта всегда работает

_"I'm really happy that DeltaChat exists and that I discovered it.
As a very early WhatsApp user, I quit WhatsApp because of privacy and security reasons;
I still have broken contacts because of that,
I do a lot of advertising for alternatives, but the market is just too fragmented.
Delta is THE solution for everyone who allow at least one
alternative - e-mail always works! :)_

**User from Germany** in 2019, via e-mail to delta@merlinux.eu


### Ждали очень долго

_"A great project, I've been waiting for a long time
for an end-to-end-encrypted chat application that gives a real alternative to the
different silos like WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram etc."_

**User from Germany** in 2019, via e-mail to delta@merlinux.eu


### Переписка с Кубой

_"I'm going to confess my love for the application.
It is really amazing, it has made me communicate more with my friends,
because writing emails is really annoying for me, I prefer chat, the world prefers chat."_

**Пользователь с Кубы** в 2019 году, по электронной почте delta@merlinux.eu


### Полностью децентрализовано

_"At /e/ we had lots of discussion about Telegram vs Signal vs ... 
But I must say that the best IM secured service in my opinion is @delta_chat
Delta Chat is using emails to transport instant messages: 
it's fully decentralized, heavily encrypted and you can reach any contact"_

**Gaël Duval**, Founder Mandrake Linux, в [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gael_duval/status/1122906779002777600)

### Decentralized but easy for users

_"People start caring about decentralization. But it seems that for a lot of people setting servers and all to use Matrix or XMPP is too complicated while you can use Delta with just an e-mail address"_

**Russian user** LGBT+ activist, from an online discussion over Telegram

### Старая добрая электронная почта прекрасно справляется

_"Recently I've come to the conclusion 
that the world doesn't need yet another instant messenger.
Good old email will do just fine.
Use #DeltaChat with your existing email account. #decentralize the net."_

**Пользователь из Польши** в 2020 году, в [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MichalNarecki/status/1280820973902745600)


### Наиболее децентрализованная концепция связи в настоящее время

_"Take the most decentralized communication concept currently available
and put on a chat app like @delta and you're done."_

**Пользователь из Германии** в 2020 году, в [Mastodon](https://mastodon.bayern/@binaryflo85/103273050438673883)


### Открытый исходный код, без разрозненности, на основе стандартов

great open-source/non-silo/standard-based replacement to whatsapp!
Glad to know that the development is keeping pace!!"_

**Séverin Lemaignan** в 2020 году, в [Twitter](https://twitter.com/skadge/status/1276515066393878529)


### Простейший способ начать общение!

_"Considering to use  @delta_chat as a default way to start chats!
Unlike other systems it empowers people on both end with choice of the agent they want to use +
interops with all the mail clients"_
