title: "Introducing the New Support Forum: Join to Help Others and Discuss Features!"
author: "compl4xx"

The Delta X Conference is taking place in Freiburg at the moment, and a lot of
cool stuff is happening here. One of the things we have been working on here is
**[https://support.delta.chat]**, our new Support Forum.

On the forum, you can help each other with bugs, and discuss feature proposals.
Good feedback creates good software, and your input is helping a lot. Only when
we know what users need, we can fulfill those needs.

Discourse is an awesome software for this, and makes discussing much easier.
It's intuitive to use for non-techie users, and it's built to support a polite
and constructive discussion. Right now, users can only discuss such topics on
GitHub, IRC, or the mailing list - and discourse has a lot of advantages
towards them.

We don't want to be dependent on GitHub, especially in these times. But no need
to make it more complicated for you, of course you can login to the Forum with
your GitHub account. Independence was also why we chose to host the Forum
ourselves, instead of going to a hoster.

This forum is just one of the things which we initiated at Delta X. We will
post about other projects in the next days, stay tuned!

Greetings from Delta X!
