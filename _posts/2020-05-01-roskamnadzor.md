On April 27th we received a letter from <a href="http://eng.rkn.gov.ru/about/">Roskomnadzor</a>, the Russian supervisor of communications and information technology. This upon request to provide access to Delta Chat user data and register with their state-run provider registry. <b>We declined for the simple reason that Delta Chat developers have no access to user data whatsoever</b>. 

Delta Chat is a decentralized messenger and doesn't have its own servers. You choose the e-mail provider which you trust yourself and we don't know about your choices. Besides, even e-mail providers won't see Delta Chat message contents because messages are end-to-end encrypted via <a href="https://autocrypt.org">Autocrypt</a>. 

Big cheers to the e-mail ecosystem sporting standardized separation of apps (MUAs), as separate from message transport (MTAs), on a planetary-scale, and a diversely operated system at that … even if a little messy and slow-moving ;)
