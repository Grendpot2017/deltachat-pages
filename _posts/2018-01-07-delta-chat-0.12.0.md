We've just released Delta Chat 0.12.0 with some minor changes and lots of bugfixes.

* Gossip keys of other group members in the encrypted payload (will also be evaluated in one of the next versions)
* Use SHA-256 instead of SHA-1 in signatures
* Make the permanent notification clickable
* Update permanent notification after import
* Fix rendering of system messages
* Various bug fixes
* Update Albanian, French, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Russian and Turkish translations

The version is available in the [Downloads section](download); due to some 
problems with F-Droid it is not clear how fast the version will be available 
there \*\*figers crossed\*\* :)
