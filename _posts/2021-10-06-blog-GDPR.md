## GDPR 2.0
It has been a while since the last update on Delta Chat privacy policy and some things have changed. We are still trying to keep personal data processing to a minimum and stick to our principle "privacy by design", but as you know, the internet does not work without data. 

We therefore appointed a data protection officer and worked out new privacy statements for the apps concerning push notifications, data in the app, app permissions and an explanation of platform dependent processing.

- a [GDPR compliance summary page for the
  Delta/Android app](https://delta.chat/en/gdpr). 
  TLDR: delta.chat has **privacy by design**: no Delta 
  servers, no address book upload, by-default e2e encryption.

- a [privacy statement for the delta.chat
  website (now in German AND English!)](https://delta.chat/de/gdpr). 
  TLDR: no cookies, no tracking, participation in e-mail mailing 
  lists only on an explicit subscription request. 

If you have any questions or comments please file issues on github 
or send a message to delta-privacy@merlinux.eu
