It has been a while since the last update on Delta Chat privacy policy and some things have changed. We are still trying to keep personal data processing to a minimum and stick to our principle "privacy by design", but as you know, the internet does not work without data. 

We therefore appointed a data protection officer and worked out new privacy statements for the apps giving, for example, more info concerning push notifications, data in the app, app permissions and an explanation of platform dependent processing.

- a [GDPR compliance summary page for the
  Delta/Android app](gdpr). 
  TLDR: delta.chat has **privacy by design**: no Delta 
  servers, no address book upload, by-default e2e encryption.

- a [privacy statement for the delta.chat
  website (now in German AND English!)](gdpr-website). 
  TLDR: no cookies, no tracking, participation in e-mail mailing 
  lists only on an explicit subscription request.
