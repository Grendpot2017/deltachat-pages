author: Bj√∂rn Petersen

We've been working on various aspects of Delta Chat these days: Profile and group images, status, fixes
[and more](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#unreleased).  However, as some of us are
in holidays these days, we decided to release a new beta version not today but end of August.
In between we would be glad to get feedback, especially about the [weired Read receipts some MUAs seems to send](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/issues/121).

Moreover, we are very happy about the many contributions to the issue tracker, the homepage, to transifex, testing and much more. We really enjoy the
growing Delta Chat community :)

We've also though about the future of the Delta Chat _project_ itself.
News about this will follow as soon as there is more to say :)
