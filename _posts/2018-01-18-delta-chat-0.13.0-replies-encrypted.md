title: Delta Chat 0.13.0 - Reply-Encrypted-Release
author: Bj√∂rn Petersen
---

Delta Chat 0.13.0 will reply encrypted if the chat partner has enabled encryption _manually_.

This is useful esp. when chatting with non-Delta-clients as K-9 or Enigmail. These clients
allow the user to encrypt only a single message _without_ having enabled 
encryption by default (if the chat partner _has_ enabled encryption by default, which is true for all Delta Chat clients, 
replies have always been encrypted).

Other changes:

* Update welcome screen graphics
* Update Norwegian, Russian and Turkish translations
+ Bug fixes

The version is available in the [Downloads section](download); due to some 
problems with F-Droid it is not clear how fast the version will be available there.
