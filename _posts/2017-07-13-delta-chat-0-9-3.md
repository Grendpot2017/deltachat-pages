As [mentioned before](2017-07-06-read-receipts-and-social-pressure), Delta Chat 0.9.3 
includes so called "Read receipts" - and some other features as ...

* Improve encryption dialog in profile
* Fix marking messages as "seen" when opening the contact requests
* Ignore signature.asc files of signed-only messages
* Update Polish, Portuguese and Russian translations

... plus tons of bug fixes. As always, the version will be 
available on F-Droid the next days.

Still missing: Multi-device setup via Autocrypt Setup Message - and much more.

Our [Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/delta-chat/delta-chat-android/) also begins breathing, however, there are still maintainers and translators needed.
We would also be glad for anyone adding new languages here.

Last, not least: Also this homepage is translateable - our newest language is Portugues - [delta.chat/pt](https://delta.chat/pt) - Obrigado, Luis!
