title: Delta Chat v0.9.0 introducing PGP
author: Bj√∂rn Petersen

Okay, a big version step from v0.1.36 to v0.9.0 - but it's also a big change:

From now on, Delta Chat supports OpenPGP-compatible end-to-end-encryption out-of-the-box with
zero configuration :-) - thanks to [Autocrypt](https://autocrypt.readthedocs.io).

The following changes ...

* Add end-to-end-encrypting following the OpenPGP and Autocrypt standards
* Add a function to compare keys
* Pimp GUI

... will then be available on F-Droid the next days. Hold on!

Little roadmap: If everything (well, most) is fine with this version, we'll go to 1.0 and to Google Play then.
