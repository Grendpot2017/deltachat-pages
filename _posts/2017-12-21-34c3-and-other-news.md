## Sessions on 34C3

Yes - Autocrypt and Delta Chat is on the _34th Chaos Communication Congress_ in Leipzig, Germany.

If you want to know more about these projects or you want to get involved, we would be very glad to see you there.

The concrete events are:

* [Autocrypt - Introduction and practical demonstration to Autocrypt, an implemented specification for opportunistic e-mail end-to-end encryption](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Session:Autocrypt)

* [Delta Chat - Try out Delta Chat with us ... usable like Telegram, but decentralized and with open community](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Session:Delta_Chat)

Thanks to Xeniax and compl4xx for submitting :)


## Transfer your key to Thunderbird

The latest Beta Version of Delta Chat (APK is available at [Downloads](download), F-Droid-Version is pending) allows you to transfer your key from Delta Chat to other Autocrypt-compatible devices. 

Already today, this works with Thunderbird and the [Enigmail Nightly Build](https://autocrypt.org/install-autocrypt-enigmail.html) - thanks to Patrick from Enigmail for the great work.

In the near future we expect this to work with other clients and Delta Chat will also be ready to _receive_ keys then.

## Autocrypt Level 1 final

Yes - and the Autocrypt specification is final.  From the [mailing list](https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/autocrypt/2017-December/000286.html):

_"At this winter solstice day, a year after the Autocrypt effort was founded at the OnionSpace in Berlin, it appears that the first Autocrypt spec gets "1.0" final."_

We're so happy that Delta Chat is a part of this :)

[Heise](https://www.heise.de/ix/meldung/Einfache-Mail-Verschluesselung-PGP-Helfer-Autocrypt-in-Version-1-0-vorgestellt-3924855.html) (popular german computer news magazin) has already reported about it and [Posteo announced to send Autocrypt-compatible headers](https://posteo.de/blog/neu-vereinfachte-e-mail-verschl%C3%BCsselung-mit-autocrypt-und-openpgp-header).

All this efforts will allow the Delta Chat users to communicate to more people encrypted - whether they're using Delta Chat or another client.


## Last, not least

With the new Albanian translation, the Delta Chat community has translated the app into 20 languages.

Without this growing community, that also helps on bugs, new features, testing, developing - here, on github and in real life - Delta Chat would not have been possible.

Have some nice days - and see you on 34C3 - or whereever :)
