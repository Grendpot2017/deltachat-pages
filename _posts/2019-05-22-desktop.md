What has changed:
- We now use another OpenPGP implementation completely written in the Rust
  programming language which we already talked about in the [Kyiv Blog Post and
  the Rustocalypse](https://delta.chat/en/2019-05-08-xyiv). Check it out!
- We implemented support for the location streaming feature, more infos about
  this feature are also included in the [Kyiv blog post](.https://delta.chat/en/2019-05-08-xyiv)
- A big improvement is that we now have signed releases for Mac, this allows 
  users to install DeltaChat Desktop without fiddling with their security
  settings. Also openssl and all other dependencies are included in the dmg
  install file. This means no more `brew install ...` for mac users!
- Build improvements for ubuntu users also took place, we now have `.deb` files
  for all major Ubuntu versions. They now automatically pull in all needed
  dependencies, so users now don't need to install them manually anymore.
- We have good news for ArchLinux users too, the updated AUR package now uses
  rpgp too

Besides build i mprovements also many smaller features and fixes landed in this
release, including:
- drafts for new messages
- some performance fixes
- importing and exporting keys works again 
- a lot of refactoring of the backand/state handling took place
