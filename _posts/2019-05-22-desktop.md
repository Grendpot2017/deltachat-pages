The new DeltaChat Desktop release v0.103.0 just got released. The Changelog is 
long but here some highlights to point out. We now use another gpg implementation
completely written in the Rust programming language which we already talked about
in the Kyiv Blog Post and the Rustocalypse. Check it out! Besides rpgp, we also
implemented support for the location streaming feature, more infos about this 
feature are also included in the Kyiv blog post. A big improvement is that we
now have signed releases for Mac, this allows users to install DeltaChat Desktop
with fiddling with their security settings. Also openssl and all other dependencies
are included in the dmg install file. This means no more `brew install ...` for mac users!
Build improvements for ubuntu users also took place, we now have .deb files for
all major Ubuntu versions. They now automatically pull in all needed dependencies,
so users now don't need to install them manually anymore. We have good news for
ArchLinux users too, the updated AUR package now uses rpgp too. Besides build
improvements also many smaller features and fixes landed in this release, including
drafts for new messages, some performance fixes, importing and exporting keys 
works again and a lot of refactoring of the backand/state handling took place.
For a full changelog look here. 

If you have any problems with this release, as ususal, please open an issue and
github so we can have a look on it!
