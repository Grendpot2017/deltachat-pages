During the [Rustocalypse](https://delta.chat/en/2019-05-08-xyiv#the-coming-delta-chat-rustocalypse)
there was also some time to push the android ui forward,
to make the whole app stable
and to implement several long-awaited features.

## And here it is: Delta Chat Android 0.500

Among the new features there is the completly **revamped chat-profile** that combines
gallery, document, settings, member list and shared chats 
ina tab layout now:

Other highlights are:
