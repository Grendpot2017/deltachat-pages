## Details about the #34C3 Delta Chat session

The session is an open Delta Chat developer/community discussion and Q/A session, talking about news and prospectives for 2018. Delta Chat is a young project and lots of things are happening. Rather than just growing "user numbers" we aim to get new folks involved and help drive the project. We'd also like to hear more folks' perspectives and feedback, to help drive and shape further Delta developments. You will also be able to install and try out Delta Chat on an Android phone or an Ubuntu Linux powered device.

At the end of the day or rather the session, Delta is a live, open and collaborative project and we are there to support those who want to try help with UI, code, documentation, trainings, testing or organizational aspects of the evolving Delta Chat effort.

Attendants do not require special knowledge about end-to-end-encryption, or be programmers. The session is open for anyone curious and interested about Delta Chat.
