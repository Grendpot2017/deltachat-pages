Cold november? No! After many weeks of development and testing,
Android releases are out now, starting the **new release series.**

What can you expect from **Delta Chat Android 1.14?**


## Swipe to Reply

A long awaited feature is now there.
Not much to explain - this is known from many other apps:

Just **swipe any message to the right**
and you'll see a quote above the compose line 
and can continue writing your message as usual.

You can quote normal text and answer with text -
but you can also quote eg. images or voice messages
and answer with images or voice messages :)


## From the machine room

As [you might know](2019-05-08-xyiv#the-coming-delta-chat-rustocalypse),
all Delta Chat platforms share the same _core library_.
that takes care of the **_really_ hard stuff** -
crypto, network, protocols, database. You get the idea.

Changes int the core are not directly visible to the user.
It is more like that: If you do not notice the core,
it does **the best job it can do.**

One example:  
When you set up a **new account**
(enter E-Mail and your password)
this _now_ only takes **a few seconds** until Delta Chat
is ready to receive and send messages.

In _older_ versions, this took easily more than one minute!

Another example, also on set up:  
Your **address book now gets prefilled** with e-mail-addresses 
you've already contacted in the past using the account you just log in to.

Last, not least, core handles and fixes
all the differences of the **different providers**,
that make the e-mail space as diverse and huge as it is.

This is the kind of stuff the core developers take care of.
A BIG "thank you" for this incredible work!


## Some more things

Some other features at a glance:

* **Disappearing messages**,
  [in the past an experimental feature](2020-07-30-summer-update#disappearing-messages),
  are available by default now.
  Any chat can now be configured 
  to delete sent and received messages after some time.
  
* Chats open at the **first unseen** message
  
* You can store things in your **Saved messages** chat since some time -
  with 1.14, this is can be done easier and faster -
  just long-tap a message and forward to "Saved messages". ‚úîÔ∏è **Saved.**

* See the [Changelogs](download#changelogs) for all the glory details :)

## What about Desktop and iOS?

Apart from the "Machine room" chapter, 
this blog post is mainly about Android this time.
