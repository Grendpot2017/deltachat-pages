title: Delta Chat 0.16.0 with Ad-hoc-groups; new Mailing list and IRC
author: Bj√∂rn Petersen
---

Delta Chat supports so called **ad-hoc groups** now - in short, groups can be created by any non-delta-client and are filed by the list of recipients.
Apart from that, "ad-hoc groups" work like usual Delta groups. See [issue #69](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core/issues/69#issuecomment-370247669) for more details and discussions.

Further changes:

* Allow **group creation though contact requests**
* Always **display the _sending_ time** in the chat list; the list itself is sorted by _receiving_ time and "Message info" shows both times now
* **Indicate ommited parts** of mails by "[...]"
* **Highlight the subject** in the "Message info"

For a complete list of changes and for the download links, see [downloads](download). As always, the version is available immediately on Github and on F-Droid in a few days.

This version requires the additional **right to access the camera**. This is needed for the upcoming QR code scanning options which can already be tested in this version, see commit [74ffbf4](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/commit/74ffbf48befbb0416337673d73d9f2482728cac6).
