A new Delta Chat UX study is out, based on interviews with people engaged 
in human rights missions in Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, Iran, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
It focuses on how Delta Chat could or can work well in conjunction with other tools, 
and for organizational settings.  The study has a particular focus on
*asymmetric* usage scenarios where "basecamp" monitors users at risk of
detention and abduction. Supporting organizational use of messenging is
a natural fit for Delta Chat which uses the e-mail system which in turn
is the primary communication tool for organizations world-wide. The
study also highlights our past and prospective future development
efforts.
