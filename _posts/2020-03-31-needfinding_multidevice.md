A new Delta Chat UX study is out, based on Xenia's interviews with people engaged 
in human rights missions in Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, Iran, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
It focuses on how Delta Chat could or can already work well in conjunction with
other tools and apps, and for organizational settings.  
The study has a particular focus on *asymmetric* usage scenarios where
"basecamp" monitors users at risk of detention and abduction. Lastly,
the study highlights our past and prospective future development aims to
address the identified needs. After all, supporting organizational use
of messenging is a good fit for Delta Chat because it uses the e-mail
system which in turn is the primary communication tool for organizations
virtually everywhere.
