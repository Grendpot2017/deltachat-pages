title: Delta Chat 0.10.0, Semantic versions, APK
author: Bj√∂rn Petersen

## New version out now

* Fix usage of multiple private keys
* Fix various memory leaks
* Update English, Portuguese and Turkish translations
* start using [semantic vesion numbers](https://semver.org/) from now on

As always, the version will be available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.b44t.messenger/) soon.
Moreover, for real experts, we've added an APK download, see below.

In the next versions it is planned to target further bugs and issues.
However, already now, without the memory leaks, we can see much clearer when
starting eg. [valgrind](http://www.valgrind.org/) :)


## Manual APK download

The following is for very experienced users only that really know what they're doing.
**Manually installed APKs are not recommended** due to a lack of automatic updates.
We recommend all users to wait for the F-Droid release.

However, if you cannot wait and really know what you're doing, you can install
the Delta Chat 0.10.0 already now directly from the [Github releases page](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/releases).

Please note, that the F-Droid version and the Github version have different signatures.
This means ...

* usually, you cannot install the one over the other
* usually, apps with different signatures cannot share data on updates

So, if you want to switch from an F-Droid release to manually installed APKs (or the other way round)
**without losing your chats**, select "Settings / Advanced / Backup / Export backup". After that, uninstall the app and select "Import backup" on reinstallation

We recommend F-Droid. You have been warned.
