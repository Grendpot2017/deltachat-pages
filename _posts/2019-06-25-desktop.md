In the last couple of weeks we released two new Desktop releases of DeltaChat
including:

- We now use different OpenPGP implementation completely written in the Rust
  programming language which we already talked about in the [Kyiv Blog Post and
  the Rustocalypse](https://delta.chat/en/2019-05-08-xyiv). Check it out!
- We implemented support for the location streaming feature, more infos about
  this feature are also included in the [Kyiv blog post](.https://delta.chat/en/2019-05-08-xyiv)
  If you want to use it, you need to enable it in `settings -> experimental features`.

- Desktop now has support for simple markdown. Give it a try!
- We now support drafts for new messages
- DeltaChat is now a lot more responsive having many chats
- Importing and exporting keys works again 
- A lot of refactoring of the backand/state handling took place
- Images in the media gallery have the corrrect size again
- Add progress indicator on login

Installing DeltaChat also got a lot easier accross many different platforms:
- The Mac install files also greatly improved. No more fiddling with dependencies
  or security settings, just install it with the .dmg and start DeltaChat!
- For Ubuntu users many build improvements also took place, we now have `.deb` files
  for all major Ubuntu versions. They now automatically pull in all needed
  dependencies, so users don't need to install them manually anymore
- ArchLinux users can use the updated AUR package now to use rpgp too
