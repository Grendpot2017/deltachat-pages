title: Yeah! Delta Chat has a blog now!
author: Bj√∂rn Petersen

Nine months of Delta Chat development and no blog ... until now. 
Seems as if we're close to Version 1.0 and have some time for such things :-)

In fact, we want to inform you from time to time about Delta Chat and related
things.

But please - if you think, there are too few posts, too few texts here:
We're just developers, no authors. And remember: Delta Chat is Open Source -
any help is welcome - also on this blog.
