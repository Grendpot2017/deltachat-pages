title: A little update - Delta Chat v0.9.1 released, Languages
author: Bj√∂rn Petersen
---

This version improves some minor things for the encryption part and makes the strings localizable, so that they can be translated
by our translators.

NB: Delta Chat is currently available in English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Korean, 
Netherlands, Polish, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.

**If your language us missing,** you're welcome to [add an translation](https://delta.chat/en/support#translations). 
Moreover, Italian, Korean and Netherlands lacks active maintainers. Of course, any help on the other languages is also welcome.

Back to the app: v0.9.1 comes with the following changes:

* Profile: Improve encryption state dialog
* Improved video quality of short clips
* Make "Encrytion" dialog localizable
* Update Russian translation

We've also added some details about the new end-to-end-encryption to the [help](https://delta.chat/en/help#encryption).

As usual, the update will be available in F-Droid the next days.

Little roadmap to version 1.0: Add a backup functionality, fix bux (if any ;-) go to Google Play.
