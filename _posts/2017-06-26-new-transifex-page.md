title: New Transifex page
author: Bj√∂rn Petersen

Translating Delta Chat can now also be done via _Transifex_, a collaborative localisation platform that seems to be widely used:

- <https://www.transifex.com/delta-chat/delta-chat-android/>

I've uploaded the existing translations, but, to be honest, I do not know much about the system.

So, I would be glad, if someone else can maintain the page. Maybe one of the existing translators?

Discussions on this point are welcome [here](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/issues/111) - and: thanks to Transifex supporting Open Source projects!
