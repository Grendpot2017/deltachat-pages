We've just released Delta Chat 0.9.6, a little bugfix release without new major features.

* Support keys generated with multiple subkeys eg. from K-9
* Show PDFs and other attachments with bad names
* Bug fixes

As always, the version will be available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.b44t.messenger/) soon.

BTW: We are still searching for **testing devices.** 
If you have some older, but functional, Android or iOS (!) devices in your drawer - if you do not need them any more, feel free to send them to 
_Delta Chat, Friedrich-Ebert-Str. 1 B, 25348 Glückstadt, Germany_
