**What is the friendica network?**
Friendica is a communications platform for integrated social communications utilising
decentralised communications and linkage to several social projects - as well
as popular mainstream providers.

The mission of friendica is to free our friends and families from the clutches of
data-harvesting corporations, and pave the way to a future where social communications
are free and open and flow between alternate providers as easily as email does today.
