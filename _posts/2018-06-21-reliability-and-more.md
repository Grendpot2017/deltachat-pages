author: Bj√∂rn Petersen

As you may have read on the mailing list, Holger and me met in Freiburg 
and dived deeper into how to **make message sending and receiving more reliabile.**

With the help of the community, the new **version 0.18.0** is the outcome of this.
At least on my testing devices, sending and receiving messages works much better now :)
See the [changelog](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#delta-chat-changelog) for more details.

But there are even more news in this version:

- **Paging through images** made available by Angelo Fuchs. 
  Extra-congratulations for closing the oldest open issue :)

- Several **connection issues** with different configurations were fixed by Thomas Oster.

- A new - and complete - **Danish** translation was added by Ole Carlsen.
  This is the 23rd translation.

For a complete list of changes and for the download links, see [downloads](download). 
As always, the version is available immediately on Github and on F-Droid in a few days.

## What else?

- Janka and Holger attended the DuD conference
  of the german data protection ministries 
  and had a **talk about Delta Chat** last week

- Flub and Holger pushed **automated tests** forward
