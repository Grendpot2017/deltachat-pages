**In the last months, the Delta Chat developers put a lot of focus on saving
traffic. The result: using Delta Chat consumes far less data now.**

It's easy to forget that many people still pay data plans by the GB - their
data traffic is **expensive, limited, and slow.** For many people, it's even a
question of money; Internet traffic can be quite expensive. In such moments,
this can be the critical difference: is an app usable at all, or does it use
too much traffic?

In the effort to save network traffic, the developers improved Delta Chat a lot
in the last months. This helps everyone with an expensive data plan. It's also
useful if your Internet connection is throttled because you ran out of data,
but the month isn't over yet.

## Which Improvements are Saving the Most Traffic?

A few things which were changed to reduce our data traffic consumption:

- Delta now avoids downloading messages that it doesn't display. This saves a
  lot of traffic through messages from blocked contacts, and huge attachments
  from ordinary emails.
- A nice side effect is that you have less slowdown when getting online with a
  busy inbox.
- We optimized the traffic on idle, when the app isn't used. In 10 minutes, it
  used to consume 6 kB - [this was reduced down to 107 bytes.](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/issues/506)
- We combined read-receipts into one message, when they are sent in the same
  moment. Before, there was an email for each read receipt.

### Changing the PGP keys to ed25519 Elliptic Curve Keys

We changed newly generated PGP Keys to the new ed25519 algorithm - those keys
are a lot smaller. This is very important, as the keys are sent in every
message at the moment.

We wanted to go for this way earlier, but we had to avoid compability issues.
Maybe you noticed that we didn't update F-Droid versions for about six months;
with all the old Delta versions around, we couldn't introduce changes like
this without risking compability.

Note that the current releases still generate RSA2048 keys by default, because
the Delta Chat testing discovered an incompatibility which was fixed in the
current releases. After the next Desktop release we should finally be able to
switch to generating ed25519 keys by default.

## What Else is Possible? A Glance Into The Future

While the above already provides for substantial reductions there are a few more ideas which developers are considering under the [save-traffic label in the core issue tracker](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asave-traffic). 

- Disabling encryption for some chats: making it possible not to send Autocrypt
  headers at all. This is highly controversial though.
- Attachment download could be postponed until you have Wi-Fi, or download it
  manually.
- Sending the key fingerprint in a special header, so we don't always have to
  download the whole Autocrypt header.
- Sending small messages through a header, thereby saving IMAP commands in the
  background.
- Not sending a key per gossip if the key was gossipped by someone else in the
  last 48 hours.
- Maybe we can avoid sending the to/cc headers to groups where everyone uses
  Delta Chat. This is a security feature, but also saves traffic.
- And finally there are some ideas about leaving out the Autocrypt header,
  when encryption *provably* works. If it stops working, it could still be
  recovered by a simple message exchange.
